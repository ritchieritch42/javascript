// There's two methods presented below.

var assignment = classroom("Kyle");

// Here we are invoking assignment inside of the homework context.
var homework = {

};

// Even though "assignment" is just a variable holding a function,
// when we call "homework.assignment()", the function is invoked with
// "homework" as the context, so "this" inside the function refers to "homework".
homework.assignment();

// Another way of setting the "this" context is by using "call()".
// This explicitly sets "this" to the provided object ("otherHomework").
var otherHomework = {

// Creating functions with the "this" keyword makes the functions dynamically accessible.
