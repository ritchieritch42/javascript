// Here is an example of how closure works
// The count variable remains in memory even after the outer function is finished
// Because of this, each time you call back on the variable counter1/counter2,
// the count increases, shown in the console log.
function makeCounter() {
    let count = 0; // outer variable which is enclosed

    return function() {
        count++;
        return count;
    };
}

let counter1 = makeCounter();
let counter2 = makeCounter();

console.log(counter1());
console.log(counter1());
console.log(counter2());
console.log(counter2());

// Here is another example using a function factory
// In this example, 'factor' is remembered and accessible outside of the multiplier function scope
// That's why we can set the factor later on and use this to define new variables, which are
// instances of the multiplier function.
// Compared to the previous example, the 'factor' variable is a FIXED  variable within the closure
// (ie, factor stays the same and isn't added to, and must be defined when calling on the multiplier
// function)

function multiplier(factor) {
    return function(number) {
        return number * factor;
    };
}

let double = multiplier(2);
let triple = multiplier(3);

console.log(double(5));
console.log(triple(5));

// Private variables example
// Notice that when we declare the person "John", after we get his age
// & celebrate his birthday, his age still persists
// Since there is a closure around getName & getAge
function person(name) {
    let age = 0;

    return {
        getName: function() {
            return name;
        },
        getAge: function() {
            return age;
        },
        celebrateBirthday: function() {
            age++;
            return `Happy Birthday, ${name}! You are now ${age} years old.`;
        }
    };
}

let john = person("John");

console.log(john.getName());
console.log(john.getAge());
console.log(john.celebrateBirthday());
console.log(john.getAge());
