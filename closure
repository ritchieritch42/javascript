// Here is an example of how closure works
// The count variable remains in memory even after the outer function is finished
// Because of this, each time you call back on the variable counter1/counter2,
// the count increases, shown in the console log.
function makeCounter() {
    let count = 0; // outer variable which is enclosed

    return function() {
        count++;
        return count;
    };
}

let counter1 = makeCounter();
let counter2 = makeCounter();

console.log(counter1());
console.log(counter1());
console.log(counter2());
console.log(counter2());
